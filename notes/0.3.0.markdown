## ScopeFilter support

Previous releases of sbt-unidoc were hardcoded to `Compile` configuration. By using [ScopeFilter feature][1] added in sbt 0.13, sbt-unidoc 0.3.0 is able to unify Scaladocs from arbiterary projects and configurations. For instance, to exclude a project:

    unidocProjectFilter in (ScalaUnidoc, unidoc) := inAnyProject -- inProjects(typelevel)

or to use only given projects:

    unidocProjectFilter in (ScalaUnidoc, unidoc) := inProjects(library, app)

Out of the box, simply adding `unidocSettings` to the root project's setting would wire `unidoc` to `Compile` configuration and `test:unidoc` to `Test`. Here is how we can aggregate both `Compile` and `Test`:

    unidocConfigurationFilter in (TestScalaUnidoc, unidoc) := inConfigurations(Compile, Test)

This feature was requested by [@inkytonik][@inkytonik] in [#2][2].

### breaking changes

String-based `excludedProjects` is now replaced with `unidocProjectFilter`.
